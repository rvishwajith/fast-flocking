# About
An experiment on an optimized bodies flocking algorithm with standard rules as well as target seeking and avoidance. Since this project is meant to be entirely CPU-based, compute shaders are avoided and Jobs-based systems are used instead for parallelism.

**Developed in Unity 2023 (URP).**
